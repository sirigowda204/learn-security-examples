Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Vulnerability Explanation:
Insecure Version (insecure.js):
The vulnerability lies in allowing session cookies to be accessed by client-side JavaScript (httpOnly set to false), enabling session hijacking via XSS. Additionally, the absence of the sameSite flag exposes the application to CSRF attacks.

Secure Version (secure.js):
The secure version addresses these vulnerabilities by setting httpOnly to true, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing session cookies, and enabling the sameSite flag to mitigate CSRF risks.

CIA Properties Violation:
Spoofing Violates:
Confidentiality: Spoofing compromises user data confidentiality by allowing unauthorized access.

Integrity: Spoofing undermines data integrity as attackers can manipulate or forge requests.

Availability: Although not directly, spoofing can lead to further security breaches, potentially impacting system availability.
