Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Vulnerability Explanation:
Insecure Version (insecure.js):
Using user-provided values directly in the MongoDB query exposes the server to NoSQL injection attacks, enabling attackers to access unauthorized data.

Secure Version (secure.js):
The secure version validates and sanitizes user input before querying the database, preventing NoSQL injection attacks.

CIA Property Violation:
Tampering Violates:
Confidentiality: Tampering compromises data confidentiality by potentially exposing sensitive information.
Additional Security Mechanisms:
Implement parameterized queries or ORM libraries.
Enforce strict access controls and authentication.
Implement logging and monitoring systems.
Regularly update dependencies.
