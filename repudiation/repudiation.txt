- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Vulnerability Explanation:
Insecure Version (insecure.js):
In the insecure version, the server allows users to send messages without any authentication. This means users can deny their actions since there's no way to trace who sent which message.

Secure Version (secure.js):
The secure version addresses this vulnerability by implementing request logging. Whenever a message is sent, the server logs the user who sent the message along with the message content. This ensures accountability and prevents users from denying their actions.

Additional Security Mechanisms:
To prevent such attacks and enhance security further:

Implement user authentication to verify the identity of users sending messages.
Use encryption techniques to secure message transmission between client and server.
Implement digital signatures or checksums to ensure message integrity and authenticity.
Implement access control mechanisms to restrict message retrieval to authorized users only.
