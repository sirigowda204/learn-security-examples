- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Vulnerability Explanation:
Insecure Version (insecure.js):
The vulnerability lies in directly using user-provided values in the MongoDB query, making it susceptible to NoSQL injection attacks, potentially leading to server overload.

Secure Version (secure.js):
The secure version handles errors gracefully, preventing the server from crashing when encountering unexpected input.

Additional Security Mechanisms:
To prevent such attacks:

Implement rate limiting.
Apply authentication and authorization.
Validate incoming requests.
Monitor server performance and scalability.
