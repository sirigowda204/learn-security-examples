Vulnerability Explanation:
Insecure Version (insecure.js):
The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper authentication. The server only checks the user's role without verifying their identity, allowing potential privilege escalation.

Secure Version (secure.js):
The secure version prevents this vulnerability by implementing session-based authentication, ensuring the user's identity is verified before allowing role updates.

Additional Security Mechanisms:
To further enhance security:

Implement secure password storage.
Use HTTPS for data encryption.
Apply role-based access control (RBAC).
Implement input validation and sanitization.
